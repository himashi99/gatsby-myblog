My plan for the upcoming week is to finally finish off the Responsive Web Design section of freeCodeCamp and obtain the certification. I have 3 more projects left to complete. I had previously created a Porfolio Webpage, but since I needed it to pass the requirements on freeCodeCamp, I recreated the webpage in CodePen today. I made the original webpage when I first started coding and it took me weeks to finish. I was able to re-create it today in a few hours, and even added some additional elements!

Items for the Upcoming Week
* Complete the Product Landing Page project for freeCodeCamp
* Finish application for Bridge School (Web Development Program)
* Prepare for phone interview on Wednesday
