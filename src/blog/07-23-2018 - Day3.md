I've been working all day on my Product Landing Page for freeCodeCamp. It's also doubling as a possible website for a friend, so I really want it to look good! I had a really bad start to the day though trying to figure out Sass and Compass. I had previously set up the project using Compass and everything was working fine i.e. the Sass file was being converted to CSS. When I went back into the project this morning however, the file was no longer being converted. I troubleshooted for a few hours, updating gems, reinstalling Ruby, Compass etc. but to no avail!

Lucikly I came accross this site https://www.taniarascia.com/learn-sass-now/ which showed me how to watch my Sass file and convert to CSS without using Compass. Hurrah my day was saved!

I'm almost done with all the freeCodeCamp requirements for this project. One requirement however is failing, and I really don't want to go to bed until I fix it. At this point though, I'm just getting frustrated and I think fresh eyes in the morning will help.
