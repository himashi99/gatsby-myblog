I finished the Product Landing Page project for freeCodeCamp early this morning, which means only 1 more project before I can get my first certificate!

Since this website may be used for a friend's company, I wanted to add more interactivity to it. My initial plan was to add the parallax effect, so I've been working on that for the majority of the day. I'm using vanilla JavaScript and the scroll looks okay for the most part, except there's a big white space at the bottom that I can't get rid of, and the code seems very messy.

I saw a few parallax plugins while browsing for solutions, so I decided to give a jQuery plugin called ScrollMagic a try. I had high hopes but alas, no parallax. Hopefully I'll have better luck tomorrow.
