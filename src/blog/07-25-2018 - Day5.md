I decided to switch gears and start the Technical Documentation Page project for freeCodeCamp, and take a break from the Bakery website.

It looked pretty straight forward, but I had never done a fixed sidebar navigation before and I'm embarrassed to admit how long it took for me to get it to look right, and work correctly. I ended up following a tutorial I found. Thank goodness for YouTube! Anyway I feel like I didn't accomplish too much today. I hate those kind of days.

Also, mental note for next week, I need to figure out how to add pictures into my markdown files.
