Got my first certificate on freeCodeCamp today!

I also stepped outside my comfort zone and went to a Networking event. It was a general meet and greet followed by "speed dating" style interviews, about 5 minutes in length. It was an interesting experience for sure, and I met some really nice developers from all different backgrounds. I don't now if anything will come of it, but I'm glad I went just for the interview experience.

I have my first Skype interview tomorrow morning. Fingers crossed that it goes well!
