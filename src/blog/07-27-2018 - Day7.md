I had my first technical interview today via Skype and it was a pretty big fail! It was a simple enough problem and I was told I could use whatever language I felt comfortable with. I attempted it with JavaScript, but for some reasons all my knowledge of the syntax seemed to fly out the window. It was such a different feeling having someone there waiting for you to solve the problem, as opposed to you on your own, taking your time.

Now normally I would be kicking myself for freezing up, but I'm attempting to embrace my failures and mistakes and look at it as a learning opportunity. I did my first technical test and it didn't kill me. I'll be better prepared next time now that I know what to expect.

In other news, I still haven't figured out why my blog posts aren't displaying. That will be a priority this weekend.
