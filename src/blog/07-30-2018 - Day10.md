I'm super excited right now because I added some additional items to my portfolio website, including a really cool "typewriter animation" with vanilla JavaScript! I did watch a tutorial on YouTube, but I actually understood the code as I followed along so yay me. When I first created the website back in February, I attempted to add the animation, and had no idea what was happening.

Anyway go check it out! https://himashi.ca/

I did have some other items on the agenda today, but as you can see, I got a little sidetracked. I know I sound dorky but JavaScript is just so fun! I can't wait to understand it better.
