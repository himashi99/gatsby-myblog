And just like that it's August 1st. The last month was kind of a mix of being really productive and avidly avoiding writing code. I fell off #100DaysofCode challenge earlier in the month. I think this was mostly due to feeling extremely overwhelmed and trying to do too many things at once. I was also allowing the voice telling me "you're not good enough" to get to me.

Since I re-started the challenge, I've been blogging every day, and so far that has seemed to help with the whole "feeling overwhelmed" thing. I set goals each Sunday for the upcoming week, and I get to reflect on my triumphs (and fails) each day.

Today I did something really fun. I went to a Ruby workshop! It was kind of nice to get out of the JavaScrpt headspace for a little while and try something new. Of course my mind was still comparing it to JavaScript! No curly brackets for if/else statements?! What's going on! Part 2 of the workshop is next week and I can't wait!

I also started the wedding page using Gatsby. I spent all morning trying to get a bottom NAV bar that turns into a sticky NAV once you scroll. It works, but not perfectly so I'll need to take a look in the morning.
