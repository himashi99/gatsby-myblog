I only coded for about an hour today on my website. I'll be working double time tomorrow to make up for today. I'm trying to figure out how to import jQuery into Gatsby. I wanted to do the wedding website on Gatsby initially but I'm using jQuery for some of the scroll functions and I haven't been able to figure out the import.

Anyway that's all I got today. I ended off the night with drinks with friends, to celebrate my friend passing the bar exam! It wasn't a straight path and there were definitely ups and downs for her. It was a nice reminder that hard work and perseverance does pay off!
