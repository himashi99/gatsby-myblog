I worked on the wedding website a bit more and added in some styling. I still have a lot left to do. When I think of it that, way I feel a bit overwhelmed so I need to stay focussed on each section.

I also happened to check my email today, because I knew the results for the first round of Bridge School Applications were to be announced before August 6th, and I made it!! The next part is the technical test which is all JavaScrpt so I need to brush up this week. The website will be put on hold until I'm finished the test.
