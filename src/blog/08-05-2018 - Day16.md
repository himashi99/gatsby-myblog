Since it was insanely hot in Toronto, I spent all day at the beach! As much as I wanted to take my laptop with me, I didn't want to risk sand getting anywhere near it. I got home pretty late, but I've been working on the wedding website for the past hour finishing up the styling for the sections that are already completed.

I also sent the site to my friend to make sure he likes the look of it so far. Hopefully it's gets positive feedback!
