I reviewed JavaScript objects and arrays, as well as ES6 arrow functions all day. I really want to get faster at solving these JavaScript problems. I do manage to solve them eventually, but I doubt that employers will give me hours to solve the technical tests for most job interviews! I hope this comes with practice.

I also need to review pure functions tomorrow. I want to be able to write the cleanest code possible.

In regards to the wedding website, I received some great feedback and constructive criticism from my friend. I'm going to try and incorporate his suggestions tomorrow.
