Today is one of those days that I'm experiencing a lot of self-doubt. I'm really struggling with JavaScript. I'm having trouble remembering syntax and figuring out where return statements need to go. I'm wondering if would help to write the syntax down on a piece of paper old school style. I've heard that has helped some people. I just feel like I should be getting this by now.

I realized that I didn't put my goals for the week this past Sunday so here goes

Items for the Upcoming Week
* Start all over with JavaScript basics
* Finalize answers to Bridge School test
* Part 2 of Ruby class on Wednesday night
* Update wedding website with client's changes
