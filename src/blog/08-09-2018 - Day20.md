I've been hard at work on the wedding website and I added a countdown timer today using vanilla JavaScript! I followed this great YouTube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJVJRFF-Y6U and was able to get it working on the first go!

All that's left now on the website is to add a wedding party section and a RSVP form. Oh and of course my least favourite part, Media Queries. I also have to clean up the code as the Sass in particular is pretty messy. I may do that before I had any more sections.
