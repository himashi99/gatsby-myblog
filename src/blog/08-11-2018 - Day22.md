I continued with the freeCodeCamp Ruby tutorial on YouTube. I'm defintely seeing some simmilarities with JavaScript in terms of Data Types and Arrays. Ruby also has a data structure simmilar to JavaScript objects but they're refered to as Hashes. Then of course there's Methods which is Ruby's name for a function. 

I have 2 more hours left of the tutorial. It's taking me awhile because I'm taking notes in addition to coding along so I have to stop the video multiple times. I feel like taking notes though is really helping me remember syntax better though.
