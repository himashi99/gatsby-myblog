What a great day today was! After a few hours of working in the morning, I was finally able to get the JavaScript to work properly for the FAQ section of the wedding website. After that, I decided I deserved a bit of a break, so I went swimming and it was so nice to step away from the computer.

I think we forget that we all need to take a break once in awhile. Especially when we're frustrated. It helps to get your mind thinking of something else, and when you come back, the solution somehow seems to reveal itself!

Anyway, after my swim, I did another hour of the Ruby tutorial. It covered loops as well as manipulating external data files. 

Hope you all had a great day as well!
