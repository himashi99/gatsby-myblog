I had to run a few errands today, so I didn't get a whole lot done. I started the Bridal Party section for the wedding website and styled it. I remember how difficult it was for me to make my Porfolio Site when I first started coding. I couldn't understand how to place things where I wanted. After taking the time to really understand flex box and CSS grid though, I can get it done pretty quickly (I absolutely love flex box!) It's just so intuitive.

Anyway I'm really excited about how the website is coming together! I still have to add the Bridesmaid section and RSVP, but I'm almost there!
