I did some more styling on the bridal party section of the wedding website. I created 2 separate buttons for the groomsmen and the bridesmaids sections. I then created a class with display: none, and added or removed the class from each section using JavaScript. However, the only problem with using display: none is that you can't use the CSS Transition properties like you could for visiblility or opacity. It took me awhile to find a workaround but I was finally able to get the transition effect using a bit of JavaScript and CSS @keyframes! I think I might revisit @keyframes later this week. I only reviewed it briefly a few months back. 

I also did some styling on the Navbar and started the RSVP Section. I'm definitely getting more comfortable with DOM Manipulation using Javascript!
