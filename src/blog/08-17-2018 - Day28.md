I finally got around to signing up for Codewars. Did a few of the questions and it seems pretty cool so far. I think it will definitely help me prepare for future technical interviews. 

I also finished the RSVP section of the wedding site. I have to set up the navigation now and then refactor my code. I also have to write the media queries. Not looking forward to that at all.
