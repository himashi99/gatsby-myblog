Today was another day where I didn't do a whole lot of coding. I tried to get through the last hour of the Ruby tutorial, but I felt like I wasn't really paying attention. I think at this point I'm bored and want to build something! I'm determined to finish it tomorrow so I can finally move on to Ruby on Rails. 

Also Dev TO retweeted my Chrome Extension article today for the 3rd time! I definitely need to write another article. I have a couple of ideas, but just haven't taken the time to put it to paper.
