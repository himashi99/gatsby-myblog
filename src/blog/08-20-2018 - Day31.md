I really thought I had it this time, but I got my rejection email from Bridge School this morning. My morning started off strong. I finished off the first chapter of Eloquent JavaScript and took notes. The email definitely threw me off though.

Instead of wallowing (well after a little wallowing), I decided to do something fun. I had seen this ad for Westjet on Instagram. Basically it was a photo made up of small tiles that were all scrambled. The tiles would then unscramble to reveal the whole photo. I tried it on a small scale with an image split into 4 tiles. The code is not the greatest, and it is not really re-useable i.e. with other images. I'm going to continue to expand on it though.
