I'm technically writing this on 8/22 but that's because last night I was rushing to get the wedding website responsive. I got an email from a company that I had applied for a job at asking to see more of my HTML and CSS work. They had already looked at my portfolio so the only projects that weren't on there were the wedding website and the bakery website.

Anyway I found this website which described a really clean way of writing media queries using Sass variables and mixins. It made the process slightly more bearable.
