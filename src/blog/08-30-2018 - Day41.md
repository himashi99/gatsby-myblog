I'm jumping back on the React train! When it comes to React, I've tried a few intro courses in person and online and kept getting lost and giving up. I then decided to create this Gatsby blog which uses React, as a way of dipping my toes in. Since I want to actually learn the basics of React and understand the reasoning behind certain things, I started the Udemy React course. So far so good!
