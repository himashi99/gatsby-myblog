Since it was the last long weekend of the summer and I didn't want to work all day, I decided to take a small break from Udemy and try the React section of freeCodeCamp. I'll get back to Udemy tomorrow and continue reading Eloquent JavaScript.

Items for the Upcoming Week
* Continue with Udemy React Course
* Continue reading Eloquent JavaScript
* Write a new article for Medium
* Apply for at least 5 jobs
