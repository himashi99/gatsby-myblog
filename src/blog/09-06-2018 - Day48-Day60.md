**Babel**
To ensure Babel converts our JSX, we include <script type="text/babel"> </script> within the Body.

**ReactDOM.render()**  
We used the ReactDOM.render method to render elements to the DOM. A method being a function attached to an object.
This method takes 2 arguments; What (JSX/element) and Where (where we want it placed in the DOM).
```
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello World</h1>,
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```
Voila! We can now see "Hello World" in our browser!
