Another great thing about this course is you actually go back and refactor old code from previous lessons using new concepts you learn throughout the course.  

For example, we can replace the code we previously wrote in the ReactDOM.render method using variables.

```
// Variable for JSX
var hello = "Hello World"

// Variable for Location
var destination = document.getElementById("app")

ReactDOM.render(
  hello,
  destination
);
