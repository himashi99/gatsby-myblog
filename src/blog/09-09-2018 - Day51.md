**The Power of Babel**  
Without Babel converting our JSX to JavaScript, which the browser understands, we would have to write more lines of code to get the same output.  

```
// Without Babel
ReactDOM.render(
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>My name is Himashi</p>
  </div>,
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```
