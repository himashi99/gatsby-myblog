**Creating a Complex Component**  
You can link to an external stylesheet the same way we did with the Stateless Functional Component or you can do inline styling.
```
// Shapes is now a complex component made of of 3 other components
var Shapes = function() {
  return(
    <div>
      <Circle />
      <Square />
      <Rectangle />
  );
}

// Render our component to the DOM by passing variable ColorSpectrum within self-closing tags.
ReactDOM.render(
  <Shapes />,
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```
