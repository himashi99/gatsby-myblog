**Props**  
1. Props is short for properties.
2. They are how components "talk" to each other.
3. They allow data to be passed from parent to child top-down (uni-directional data flow).
4. Props Contain immutable data (not changing)

**Props with Stateless Functional Components**

```
// curly brackets indicate a JavaScript expression we want to evaluate
// props argument will be a JavaScript object
// our expression is the props JavaScript object we want to evaluate
// on our props object, we want to evaluate the value of the name property on that object (we need to pass this from top down)

let Person = function(props) {
  return(
    <h1>Hi, {props.name}</h1>
  );
}

// behind the scene, it looks like this
// let props = {
//  name: "Himashi"
// }

// name automatically belongs to the props object
// you can pass in multiple prop values for name
ReactDOM.render(
  <div>
    <Person name="Himashi"/>
    <Person name="Rob"/>
    <Person name="Sarah"/>
  </div>,
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```
