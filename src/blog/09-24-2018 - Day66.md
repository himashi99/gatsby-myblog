**State**
1.Fat arrow functions preserve the "this" context when they are called


```
// since we need to track state, we need to use a class component
// h2 tag with initial state - curly braces with JavaScript we want to evaluate
// constructor method is a special function for ES6 classes in JavaScript
// Whenever an object is created via a class in JavaScript, JavaScript invokes the constructor function
// React will invoke the constructor with the props and context of the Component
// Super keyword invokes the constructor function defined by React.Component which executes some necessary setup code for our Component
// it is important to call super whenever we define a constructor function
// if you would like to set a property or access "this" inside the constructor, you need to call super();
// if a component doesn't use props or context, its okay to not pass those along
// constructor method with props object
// super keyword and pass to it a value of props

class GuessAge extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // within constructor function we will set the state initially for our component
    // set this.state to a JS object with the property of age
    this.state = {
      age: 'Guess my Age'
    };

    // inside the render method, the "this" keyword is bound to the component with access to its methods
    // inside the constructor method though, with ES6 classes, properties of do not automatically bind to the React class instance
    //if we define our own custom component method for an ES6 class component, we have to manually bind this to the component ourselves
    // the function's bind method allows you to specify what the "this" variable inside a function body should be set to
    // redefining the component method onButtonClick, and setting it to the same function, but bound to "this" (the component)
    // now whenever onButtonClick executes, "this" will reference the component and not null
    this.onButtonClick = this.onButtonClick.bind(this);
  }
  // this.setState to change our state
  // put in our age property that we're going to set to a new state of 30
  onButtonClick() {
    this.setState({
      age: '30'
    });
  }
  render() {
    return(
      <div>
        <h1>Guessing Game</h1>
        <h2>{this.state.age}</h2>
        <button.onClick={this.onButtonClick}>Reveal my Age</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
ReactDOM.render(
    <GuessAge/>,
    document.getElementById('app')
);
```
