I spent a bit of time coding on freeCodeCamp today but the majority of the day was spent prepping for a networking event that was held in Toronto.

Basically a bunch of startups across the city had their doors open and you could go in and talk to other employees, hand in resumes if there were job openings etc. Unfortunately since the startups are located in various parts of the city, I had to narrow it down to 5 companies out of over 100.

It actually ended up being such a fun event. I had a chance to learn more about some really cool startups. There were a few job openings as well so I handed out my resume.

I also learned that Shopify has an internship program that they run multiple times throughout the year. Unfortunately I just missed the deadline for the winter session so I'm excited to apply for the next round!
