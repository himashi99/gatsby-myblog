I created my fashion blog on Wordpress last year, before I knew much about web development. When I was notified about renewing the hosting for the website, I realized I could re-create it using Gatsby, and host in on Netlify as I do for a lot of my other sites. So that's what I worked on today.

It's definitely going to take some time, but I like the idea of having more control over the look and feel of the site.
