I'm having so much fun with this 21 Day challenge. Some days, the questions are super simple and just build on previous questions you have answered. Other days, they take a lot longer to complete. It's reminding me how much I like JavaScript though. I woke up randomly at 4:00am today. I noticed the question for the day was up, so I grabbed my laptop and finished it!
