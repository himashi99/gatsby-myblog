I've been finding myself comparing where I am with coding, with others a lot lately, and because of this, I think I'm going to take a small break from social media. Since that includes Twitter, I won't be doing daily updates on what I'm up to, but I will of course be writing daily blog posts.

I spent some time on Codewars today. I'm trying to get faster at solving these problems so that I am interview ready.
