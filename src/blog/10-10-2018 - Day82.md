In preparation for yesterday's interview, I looked over something that I had never really thought about before, and that's HTML Email Templates. We all see them in our inboxes everyday in the form of newsletters or store emails we forgot we signed up for. Even though you are using HTML, it can be a very different process than creating a website. There are many more restrictions. These emails also have to be responsive across multiple different email clients. Given all that, it's amazing that people are able to produce such creative content. From now on, I'll definitely appreciate this fact more when I see these store emails flood my inbox!
