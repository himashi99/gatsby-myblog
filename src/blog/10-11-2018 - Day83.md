I was working on a question on freeCodeCamp today where you were asked to manipulate the object given certain rules. It took me a really long time to finally solve it. When I looked at the forums and saw how other people had done it, I realized that all you needed was nested if/else statements! If I had first written pseudo code first, I probably would have figured this out a lot faster and my code would be cleaner.
