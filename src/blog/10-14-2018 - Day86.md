Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) explains how to make web content more accessible for those with disabilities. There are multiple guidelines, and each guideline has certain testable criteria, divided into 3 levels (A, AA, and AAA). These levels have increasing complexity when it comes to implementation.

For most government websites, certain guidelines that fall under levels A and AA must be followed, such as keyboard accessibility, and contrast between text and background.
