I worked on my fashion blog for a bit, but the thing I'm most excited about is coming up with an idea for my next project. I'm going to make a  website full of my mom's recipes for Sri Lankan dishes. She's such a good cook and most people have never tried authentic Sri Lankan food before. I'm hoping to start this project in a week or so.
