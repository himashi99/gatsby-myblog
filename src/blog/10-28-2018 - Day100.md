I discovered something really cool today. Have you noticed how when you place a link on Facebook, it usually has an image and some meta information associated with the link? Well Open Graph Protocol is what makes this possible. It allows a webpage to be integrated into a social graph (Facebook for example) as a rich object. Once it's displayed, your rich object now has the same functionality as a Facebook page. It's really easy to add to you own page as well. All you need is a few meta tags that you put into the head section of you page.

```
<head>
  <meta property="og:title" content="Himashi Hettege Dona" />
  <meta property="og:type" content="website" />
  <meta property="og:url" content="https://himashi.ca/" />
  <meta property="og:image" content="assets/image-me" />
</head>
```
